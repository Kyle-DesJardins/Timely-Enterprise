			<Paragraph1>We lost control of it.  Dammit, I warned them!  We kept trying to make more and more powerful versions, but we’ve gone too far.  To hell with my promises - I gotta show everyone what’s actually going on! But they ain’t gonna believe me.  I need proof…  I gotta translate that damn tablet they keep.  Nobody knows what it says but them.  If this priest guy they killed was right, then there’s a cipher somewhere in HQ that can translate the rest of that tablet.  I’m gonna take it from them!   I can stay unseen if I want.  And if I do run into one of those bastards, so much the better.  They deserve to be hurt.   </Paragraph1>

			<Paragraph1>I’m not gonna make it.  They’re gonna find me and kill me just like they did that priest and that midwife and everyone else who got close to their secret.  I didn’t even finish deciphering the tablet.  I’m hiding this journal and these documents I found in their files.  If you get this, then for the love of Christ finish translating the tablet - they keep the cipher in their office.  It’s gotta be important.  And... I’m sorry.  </Paragraph1>
