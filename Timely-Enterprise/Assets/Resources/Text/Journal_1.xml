			<Paragraph1>We buried the child at sunset.  That makes forty.  Forty die, seven survive.  Most are dead before the leave the womb.  Those who survive the birth rarely make it through the night.  It’s been the same for almost a year now.  The townspeople say that we upset the gods.  I don’t know.  Maybe it’s a disease.  The village healer isn’t seeing anyone, not letting anyone in.  He even posted guards outside his house.  He’s become transfixed on…  something.  We need him back.  If this is some sort of disease, we need his help.  I’m going to try sneaking past his guards - even fight them if need be - and find out what he’s doing.  This is too important for him to ignore.  </Paragraph1>

			<Paragraph1>In the doctor’s office, I found some old tablet they must have dug out of the ruins this town was built on.  The healer’s no historian - why is he so interested in this tablet?  It’s got some sort of writing on it that I don’t recognize.  Here, I sketched out what it looks like.   He’ll be back soon.  I’m going to confront him about this.  </Paragraph1>
